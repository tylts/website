        I know what you're thinking - "Another calculator!?! How is this one any
        different than the other thousand I've seen?"
      </h1>
      <p>
        Well for starters, this one looks dope. The logic and DOM magic is all
        coded in vanilla JavaScript and it's styled using basic CSS. I based the
        functionality on my iPhone's calculator because that's what I had on
        hand to test it all out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep hitting equal after an equation and the calculator will continue
        evaluating based on the previous calculation. The percent button took me
        the longest to hack out. The iPhone calculator treats the percent button
        differently whether it's the first number in the equation or the second;
        also addition/subtraction vs multiplication/division. I wanted my
        calculator to reflect that, so for example you'll see that if you type 3
        and then % the display will show 0.03 which is 3/100. However if you
        want to increase 3 by 6%, you can type 3 + 6% and the display will
        immediately show 6% of 3 before adding it all together by hitting the =
        key. Just TRY IT! Use your keyboard!
